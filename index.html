        <h2>Event Details</h2>
        <p>In schools, intramurals refer to organized sports or physical activities that take place within the school community, 
            involving students and sometimes faculty members. Unlike traditional competitive sports that involve inter-school 
            competitions, intramurals are typically designed for participants within the same school.</p>
            
        <p>The purpose of intramurals is to promote physical activity, teamwork, and a sense of community within the school. These 
            activities may include a variety of sports such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, and other recreational games. Intramurals 
            often provide an inclusive environment where students of all skill levels can participate, fostering a spirit of friendly competition 
            and cooperation. The term "intramural" is derived from the Latin words "intra" (meaning within) and "murus" (meaning wall), 
            suggesting activities that take place within the walls or boundaries of a particular institution, in this case, a school.
